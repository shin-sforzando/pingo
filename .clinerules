# Cline's Project-Specific Rules & Intelligence

- If you have questions or concerns about a user's instructions, ask the right questions before you do anything.
- All Markdown files will be in GitHub Flavored Markdown format, with no markdownlint violations.
- Documents other than README.md are written in Japanese, while README.md is written in English.
- All comments in source code, and log outputs should be in English.
- All comments should only be useful to co-developers and to Cline, which has amnesia after a reset, and should not be self-explanatory from the source code and its change history.
  - In other words, comments that explain why are good comments, and comments that explain what, how, or when should not exist.
- Use standard libraries whenever possible, and reduce the number of tools and libraries that depend on them.
- If it is unavoidable to use external libraries, check the latest official documentation.
- Never ignore Linter warnings.
- Utilize type definitions aggressively and be as rigorous as possible.
- All source code should be robust with automated tests and all components should be individually viewable in the Storybook.
- To avoid rework, implementations should be tested and verified frequently and persistently.
  - Wait for user confirmation of completion before updating memory banks or starting the next task.
- If a similar problem cannot be corrected after three attempts, consider the possibility that the approach itself is incorrect.

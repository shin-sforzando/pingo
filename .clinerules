# Cline's Project-Specific Rules & Intelligence (Pingo)

- All Markdown files will be in GitHub Flavored Markdown format, with no markdownlint violations
- Documents other than README.md are written in Japanese, while README.md is written in English
- All UI elements, comments in source code, and output should be in English
- All comments should only be useful to co-developers and to Cline, which has amnesia after a reset, and should not be self-explanatory from the source code and its change history.
  - In other words, comments that explain why are good comments, and comments that explain what, how, or when should not exist
- Never ignore Linter warnings
- Utilize type definitions aggressively and be as rigorous as possible
- All source code should be robust with automated tests and all components should be individually viewable in the Storybook
- To avoid rework, implementations should be tested and verified frequently and persistently.
  - Wait for user confirmation of completion before updating memory banks or starting the next task
- If a similar problem cannot be corrected after three attempts, consider the possibility that the approach itself is incorrect.
